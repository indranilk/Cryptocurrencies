# Cryptocurrencies

Objective

In this project we were analyzing the cryptocurrency dataset. We used a clustering algorithm and created a report of all cryptocurrencies on the trading market. We loaded the dataset. We created dataframes of the crypto data. We later used PCA algorithm to reduce data dimensions. We also used K-Means algorithm to help find the best value for K. After running K-means algorithm we could predict K clusters for cryptocurrencies data.
